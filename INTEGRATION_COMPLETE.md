# âœ… Frontend-Backend Integration Complete!

## What Was Done

### Backend Changes

1. **Created UserMeal Model** (`/backend/models.py`)
   - Tracks meals logged by users
   - Supports serving multipliers for portion sizes
   - Stores date and time of consumption
   - Calculates total nutrition based on servings

2. **Added API Endpoints** (`/backend/app.py`)
   - `POST /api/user-meals/log` - Log a meal
   - `GET /api/user-meals/history` - Get meal history with date filtering
   - `GET /api/user-meals/daily/:date` - Get meals for specific date with totals
   - `DELETE /api/user-meals/:id` - Delete logged meal
   - `PUT /api/user-meals/:id` - Update logged meal

3. **Database Migration**
   - Created `user_meals` table
   - Migration already applied: `add_user_meals_table`

### Frontend Changes

1. **Created API Service Layer** (`/frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
   - Centralized API calls with authentication
   - Type-safe interfaces for all endpoints
   - Helper functions for headers and error handling

2. **Updated Dashboard** (`/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
   - Fetches real user meals from backend
   - Shows actual daily totals and progress
   - Displays logged meals with dining hall info
   - Loading and error states

3. **Updated LogMeal** (`/frontend/src/pages/LogMeal.tsx`)
   - Search and filter real Temple meals
   - Filter by dining hall and category
   - Log meals with one click
   - Shows nutrition info before logging

4. **Updated Search** (`/frontend/src/pages/Search.tsx`)
   - Browse all Temple dining meals
   - Filter by dining hall
   - Real-time search functionality
   - Shows meals in table format

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Make sure database is seeded with Temple meals
python3 seed_data.py

# Start Flask server (runs on port 5001)
python3 app.py
```

**Expected output:** `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5001`

### 2. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start Vite dev server
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:** `Local: http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Test the Integration

#### **Register/Login**
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
3. Create an account with email and password
4. You'll be automatically logged in

#### **Set Up Profile** (Recommended)
1. Go to Profile page
2. Fill in your info: age, weight, height, gender
3. Select activity level and goal
4. Toggle "Auto-calculate" to get personalized macros
5. Save profile

#### **Log Meals**
1. Go to "Log Meal" page
2. Use search bar to find meals (e.g., "chicken", "pizza")
3. Filter by dining hall if desired
4. Click "Log This Meal" on any meal card
5. See success message

#### **View Dashboard**
1. Go to Dashboard
2. See your logged meals for today
3. View macro breakdown and progress bars
4. Check if totals match your logged meals
5. Navigate between tabs (Overview, Today's Meals, Nutrition)

#### **Search Meals**
1. Go to Search page
2. Browse all available Temple meals
3. Use filters to narrow down results
4. See nutrition information in table

### 4. Verify Data Flow

#### Check if meals are being logged:
```bash
# In backend directory, open Python shell
cd backend
python3

# Run these commands:
from app import app
from models import UserMeal
from database import db

with app.app_context():
    meals = UserMeal.query.all()
    for meal in meals:
        print(f"{meal.user_id}: {meal.meal.name} - {meal.total_calories} cal")
```

## API Base URL

The frontend is configured to connect to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5001/api
```

If you need to change this, edit `/frontend/src/services/api.ts`:
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5001/api';
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to load meals data"
**Solution:** Make sure backend is running and database is seeded

### Issue: "Authentication error"
**Solution:** Clear localStorage and log in again
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.clear()
```

### Issue: "No meals found"
**Solution:** Seed the database:
```bash
cd backend
python3 seed_data.py
```

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution:** Backend already has CORS enabled for all origins. Check that backend is running on port 5001.

## Next Steps

Now that the frontend is connected to the backend, you can:

1. **Add More Temple Meals** - Update `seed_data.py` with more dining hall options
2. **Implement Meal History** - Add a history page to view past meals
3. **Add Quick Log** - Create meal templates for frequently eaten meals
4. **Weight Tracking** - Connect weight tracking to the backend
5. **Meal Planning** - Plan meals in advance
6. **Export Data** - Allow users to export their nutrition data
7. **Social Features** - Share meals with friends
8. **Mobile App** - Build a React Native or PWA version

## Tech Stack Summary

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Library:** Material-UI (MUI)
- **Backend:** Flask + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens (Flask-JWT-Extended)
- **API:** RESTful with JSON responses
